        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>The National Association of Car Wash Operators was first established in 2012. Its formation and establishment was prompted by a need to organize the car wash operators sector. The sector has not been organized and properly regulated despite its role in job creation and crime reduction. NACWO has been established to address all the challenges and provide solutions to the sector.</p>
        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p>NACWO is dedicated to creating Car wash businesses that are customer-friendly, effective, efficient, and sustainable.</p>
        <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
        <p>The Associationâ€™s primary objective is to champion the struggle for long-term sustainability and profitability of car wash operators throughout South Africa. We aim to create vibrant, viable, and people-centered platforms for business opportunities, tourism promotion, and arts and culture in communities.</p>
